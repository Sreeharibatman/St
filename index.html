    <section>
        <h2>1. How do I create a new repository?</h2>
        <p>To create a new repository on GitHub, you can follow these steps:</p>
      <ol>
      <li>Log into your Github account<br><strong> In the upper-right corner of any page, select +,then click New repository</strong></li>
    <img src="Github faq/repo-create-global-nav-update.webp"height="200" width ="200">
        <li>Optionally, to create a repository with the directory structure and files of an existing repository, select the Choose a template dropdown menu and click a template repository. You'll see template repositories that are owned by you and organizations you're a member of or that you've used before. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template">"Creating a repository from a template"</a></li><br>
        
<li>Optionally, if you chose to use a template, to include the directory structure and files from all branches in the template, and not just the default branch,select <strong>Include all branches</strong>.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Use the <strong>Owner</strong> dropdown menu to select the account you want to own the repository.<img src="Github faq/create-repository-owner.webp" height="200" width="350"></li>
        <br>
        <li>Type a name for your repository, and an optional description.<img src="Github faq/create-repository-name.webp" height="200" width="350"></li>
        <br>
        <li>Choose a repository visibility. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/about-repositories#about-repository-visibility">"About repositories."</a></li>
        <br>
        <li>If you're not using a template, there are a number of optional items you can pre-populate your repository with. If you're importing an existing repository to GitHub, don't choose any of these options, as you may introduce a merge conflict. You can add or create new files using the user interface or choose to add new files using the command line later. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/migrations/importing-source-code/using-the-command-line-to-import-source-code/importing-an-external-git-repository-using-the-command-line">"Importing an External Git respository using the command line,"</a> <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/adding-a-file-to-a-repository#adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line">"Adding a file to a repository,"</a>and<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/addressing-merge-conflicts">"Addressing merge conflicts"</a></li>
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li>You can create a README, which is a document describing your project. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes">"About READMes"></a></li>
          <br>
          <li>You can create a .<em>gitignore file</em>, which is a set of ignore rules. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/ignoring-files">"Ignoring files"</a></li>
          <br>
          <li>You can choose to add a software license for your project. For more information,<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/licensing-a-repository">"Licensing a repository </a>"</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <li>Optionally, if the personal account or organization in which you're creating uses any GitHub Apps from GitHub Marketplace, select any apps you'd like to use in the repository.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Click <strong>Create repository</strong></li>
        <br>
        <li>At the bottom of the resulting Quick Setup page, under "Import code from an old repository", you can choose to import a project to your new repository. To do so, click <strong>Import code</strong>.</li>

        <h2>2. Can I contribute to someone else's repository?</h2>
        <p>Yes, you can contribute to other repositories by</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Fork the original repository: Forking will create an exact duplicate of the original repository to your own account.</li>
<br>
<li>Clone the forked repository onto your local machine</li>
        <br>
<li>Create a branch, make changes, commit</li>
        <br>
<li>Push the new branch to your fork</li>
        <br>
<li>Now go to the original repository, go to the pull requests tab and open a new pull request. GitHub might even suggest creating a pull request without even needing to go to the pull requests tab.</li>
        <br>
<li>Explain what the changes are, and why they are necessary</li>
<br>
<li>Someone from the original repository will review your code, and might request some changes or they'll reject the PR</li>
<br>
<li>Assuming the PR was not rejected, it should be merged by one of the maintainers at some point</li>
      </ol>

        <p>A Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before your changes are merged into the base branch.</p>

        <h2>5. How do I handle merge conflicts?</h2>
        <p>Here's how you can resolve the conflict:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Here's how you can resolve the conflict:<br> <img src="Github faq/IMG_20231125_215109.jpg" height="200" width="350"</li>
        <br>
        <li>Identify the one or more conflicting files:<br> <img src="Github faq/IMG_20231125_215332.jpg" height="200" width="350"</li>
        <br>
        <li>Open the conflicting file using a text editor:<br> <img src="Github faq/IMG_20231125_215802.jpg" height="200" width="350"</li>
        <br>
        <li>Resolve the conflict. The conflicting changes are marked by <<<<<<< HEAD and >>>>>>>. You need to choose which changes to keep and which to discard. Manually edit the file to combine the conflicting changes <br>Here's an example <br> <img src="Github faq/IMG_20231125_220142.jpg" height="200" width="350"></li>
          <br>
        <p>In this example, I changed the website heading to Sample text 1, while you have changed the heading to Sample text 2. Both changes have been added to the file. You can now decide which heading to keep or edit the file to combine the changes. In either case, remove the markers that indicate the beginning and end of the changes, leaving only the code you want:</p>
          <br>
        <img src="Github faq/IMG_20231125_220644.jpg" height="200" width="350">
          <br>
          <li>Save all of your changes, and close your editor.</li>
          <br>
          <li>Add the file to the staging area:<br> <img src="Github faq/IMG_20231125_221022.jpg" height="200" width="350"></li>
          <br>
          <li>Commit the changes:<br> <img src="Github faq/IMG_20231125_221429.jpg" height="200" width="350"></li>
          <br>
          <p>This command commits the changes with the message Resolved merge conflict.</p>
          <br>
          <li>Push the changes to the remote repository:<br> <img src="Github faq/IMG_20231125_222003.jpg" height="200" width="350"></li>
